<h3>Starting Apache</h3>
<p>Go back to the XAMPP Control Panel from Step 1 and start Apache.</p>

<h3>Opening the site</h3>
<p>Follow <a href="http://localhost/">this link</a>. You should see the Heatherscratch home page.</p>
<p>If you get "OMG. Scratch could not connect to memcached", make sure php_memcache is enabled in php.ini and that memcached is running.</p>

<h3>Fixing profile pictures</h3>
<p>Sign up for an account and then log in.</p>
<p>Instead of the default pfp, you'll see "scratch code".</p>
<p>If you try to set your pfp to something else, you'll get an error.</p>
<p>To fix this, rename app\webroot\static\rename2icons\ to icons\.</p>
<p>Everything should now work.</p>

<h3>Setting yourself as admin</h3>
<p>Open CMD under C:\XAMPP\MYSQL\BIN\ and run this command:</p>
<br/><p>UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE username = 'yourusername';</p><br/>
<p>You have to replace yourusername by your username.</p>
<p>Log out then log back in and you should now be an admin!</p>
<p>You can now enjoy the admin-specific stuff, such as http://localhost/administration/</p>

<h4>Congratulations! You are done!</h4>
<p>If you want to manipulate the database further, open http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and avoid breaking anyhing!</p>
<p>To upload projects, go to http://localhost/services/share_project</p>
<br/>
<p>Everything included in HeatherscratchR should now work.</p>
<p>If you want anything that's not included in HeatherscratchR, the guides for them will come later.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Heatherscratch On!</b></p>
